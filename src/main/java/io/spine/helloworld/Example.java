 * This example application demonstrates sending a command to a server, observing the results

 * separate applications):
 * <ol>
 *     <li>In-process server configured to serve the Hello Context.
 *     <li>A client connected to the in-process server.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>The client:
 * <ol>
 *    <li>generates a {@link Print} command;
 *    <li>subscribes to {@link Printed} events that would be generated in response to the command;
 *    <li>posts the command to the server.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>After the command is posted and handled, the application terminates.
